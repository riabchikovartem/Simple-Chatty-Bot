The project is made by Artem Riabchikov & OpenAI based on hyperskill.org project "Simple Chatty Bot" using Kotlin.
Description from hyperskill: 
Here, at the beginning of your programmer’s path, creating a simple console chat bot will do wonders to guide you through the basics of coding.
During this journey you will also play some word and number games that you are going to implement all on your own. Pack up and let’s hit the road, my friend!
